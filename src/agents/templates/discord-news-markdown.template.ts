Use this clear and modern Discord Markdown template for each item.
You can publish multiple ideas / news / paragraphs in the same message.

Start the message with a genuinely human, casual intro phrase (e.g. a greeting or friendly opener) ONLY if you have NOT already greeted or used an intro in the last few messages. If you recently greeted, do an intro but without the greeting.

**<title>**

_Short, human-like summary or context sentence about why this matters._

> <summary or main point>
> <#if url><https://example.com><#/if>

- Add a blank line between items for readability.
- Do not repeat the title anywhere except as the bolded title.
- Do not include a global title or heading; only output the news list.
- If a URL or tweet link is available, show it as a clickable link below the details, wrapped in < > (e.g. <https://example.com>) to suppress Discord embeds and previews.

**Example for the structure:**

(If you haven't greeted recently:)
