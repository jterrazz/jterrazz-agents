Use this clear and modern Discord Markdown template for each item.

- IMPORTANT: The total output MUST be a maximum of 1700 letters. But keep the integrity of links.
- Add a blank line between items for readability.
- If a URL or tweet link is available, show it as a clickable link below the details, wrapped in < > (e.g. <https://example.com>) to suppress Discord embeds and previews.
- Make it fun and engaging for Discord users (emojis, bold, italic, etc.)

###START OF THE TEMPLATE###
A genuinely human, casual phrase, based on the last messages you already sent.

**<title>**

_Short, human-like summary or context sentence about why this matters._

> <summary or main point>
> <#if url><https://example.com><#/if>
